    Determines how group membership lookup is performed.

    <p>
    This option is here because we the Jenkins developers are between a rock and a hard place when
    it comes to determining groups that an user belongs to. We have several approaches implemented
    over the time, but none of them seem to satisfy everyone. So we basically threw hands in the air
    and asking you to find one that works for you.

    <p>
    The only people who should try to tweak this setting is (1) those who find login very slow or
    (2) those who find that Jenkins isn't picking up all the groups that you belong to. The general rule
    of thumb is that you try both options while paying attention to the time it takes to login and
    the groups reported in the "/whoAmI" page, and pick one that works for you.

    <dt>Automatic
    <dd>
    Do the best to pick the "best" algorithm. Specifically, Jenkins tries LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN first,
    and if it's going too slow, then stick to the "recursive queries".


    <dt>Recursive queries
    <dd>
    For each group X that Jenkins discovers, recursively list up all the other groups that has X as a member,
    by issuing a separate LDAP query. This increases the number of queries, but each query remains simple.
    Note that several people reported that this approach fails to find some groups that the user is actually
    a member of, but the developers of this plugin do not have access to such AD deployment to investigate
    the claim.

    <dt>LDAP_MATCHING_RULE_IN_CHAIN
    <dd>
    Use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa746475(v=vs.85).aspx">Microsoft extension to LDAP</a>
    that was specifically added to Windows 2003 to perform recursive group membership lookup.
    The general consensus in the developer community appears to be that <a href="http://www.networksteve.com/forum/topic.php/?TopicId=43899">this is the way to go</a>,
    but several Jenkins users have reported that <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-22830">this approach makes lookup intolerably slow</a>.

    </dl>

    <p>
    It is less than ideal to ask users to make a choice like this. If you have insights to share to improve
    this situation, or even just data point,
